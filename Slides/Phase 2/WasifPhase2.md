# Outline

## Week 1 - Intro to Data Science
* Intro to Data Science
  * DS intersection of ML/CS/Domain Expertise, just finished 1 month of CS
    * Popular domains (technical, financial, medical, social, political, economical)
  * Now 2 months of ML and then final project will be on domain expertise
  
* Intro to ML
  * Definition of learning - A computer program is said to **learn** from experience ```E``` with respect to some task ```T```and performance measure ```P``` if its performance at task ```T```, as measured by ```P```, improves with experience E
  * Examples of the above definition
  * 3 categories (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement)
    * List algorithms of each to give context on what we'll be covering

* ML tools
  * numpy, pandas 
  
* Problems of ML
  * Bias/complexity trade-off
    * Line of best fit vs completely fitting data
  * Function complexity vs Amount of training data
  * Dimensionality of input space
  * Noise of output
