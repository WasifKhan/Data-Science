# Outline

## Week 1 - Intro to Data Science
* Intro to Data Science
  * DS intersection of ML/CS/Domain Expertise, just finished 1 month of CS
    * Popular domains (technical, financial, medical, social, political, economical)
  * Now 2 months of ML and then final project will be on domain expertise
  
* Intro to ML
  * A computer program is said to **learn** from experience ```E``` with respect to some task ```T```and performance measure ```P``` if its performance at task ```T```, as measured by ```P```, improves with experience E
  * Examples of the above definition
  * 3 categories (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement)
    * List algorithms of each to give context on what we'll be covering
  
  
* Supervised Learning
  * Definition - make this a recurring them throughout algorithms
  * Line of best fit vs completely fitting data
    * Ockham's Razer/Over and Underfitting
  * Algorithms
    * Regression, etc..
 * Unsupervised Learning
   * Definition
 * Reinforcemnt Learning
   * Definition
   
 ## Week 2
 
 * Knn
   * Overfitting/underfitting 
   * Cross validation
